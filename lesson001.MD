Golang Variables and Types
Variables
In Go, variables are used to store data values that can be manipulated or processed in your programs. Variables have a name, a type, and a value. Go is a statically-typed language, meaning you need to declare the type of a variable when you create it.

Variable Declaration
You can declare a variable in Go using the var keyword. Here's the syntax:

go
Copy code
var variableName type
Example:

go
Copy code
var age int
Variable Initialization
You can also initialize a variable at the time of declaration:

go
Copy code
var name string = "John"
Short Variable Declaration
Go provides a shorter way to declare and initialize variables using := when the type can be inferred from the value:

go
Copy code
name := "Alice"
Zero Values
In Go, variables are assigned a "zero value" if not explicitly initialized. Zero values depend on the variable's type, for example, 0 for numeric types, an empty string "" for strings, and nil for reference types.

Data Types
Go has several basic data types, which include:

Numeric Types:

int (signed integers)
uint (unsigned integers)
int8, int16, int32, int64 (signed integers with specific sizes)
float32, float64 (floating-point numbers)
complex64, complex128 (complex numbers)
String Type:

string
Boolean Type:

bool
Derived Types:

array (fixed-size array)
slice (dynamic array)
map (key-value data structure)
struct (composite data type)
interface (type that defines a set of methods)
Type Conversion
You can convert a value from one type to another using type conversion. For example:

go
Copy code
var x int = 42
var y float64 = float64(x) // Convert int to float64
Constants
In addition to variables, Go allows you to declare constants using the const keyword. Constants are like variables, but their values cannot be changed once set.

go
Copy code
const pi = 3.14159
